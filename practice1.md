# File System Basic Challenge

## Challenge Objective

Navigate a structured directory system according to specific requirements.  
This challenge will test your ability to use essential Linux commands: `pwd`, `cd`, and `ls` to explore a file system.

---

## Challenge Description

A critical system backup file named `backup.dat` exists somewhere in the system. However, multiple decoy files with the identical name have been scattered throughout the directory structure.

The **authentic file** has these specific characteristics:

- **Named:** `backup.dat`
- **Exactly 2048 bytes** in size
- **Non-executable**
- **Hidden in a non-obvious location**

---

Your mission is to navigate through this complex structure using Linux command-line tools to examine each instance of `backup.dat` and identify the authentic file based on its unique attributes.

---

**Good luck!**
