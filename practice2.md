## Challenge Objective  
Create, navigate, and manipulate a structured directory system according to specific requirements. This challenge will test your ability to use essential Linux commands: mkdir, touch, rm, cp, pwd, cd, and ls to build, explore, and modify a file system.

## Challenge Description
### Setup
Begin by creating a base directory structure in your home directory:
Create a directory called project_hub in your home directory.
Inside project_hub, create three subdirectories: docs, code, and backups.
Navigate to each directory to verify their creation.
File Creation and Management
In the docs directory, create three text files: readme.txt, instructions.txt, and notes.txt.
In the code directory, create two files: script.py and config.json.
Create a hidden file called .settings in the project_hub directory.
Navigation and Verification
Use appropriate commands to list and verify the contents of each directory.
Navigate between directories using both absolute and relative paths.
At each step, verify your current location.
File Operations
Copy readme.txt from docs to the backups directory.
Create a new directory called archive inside backups.
Copy all files from docs to the archive directory.
Remove the instructions.txt file from the original docs directory.
Advanced Structure
Create a nested directory structure: project_hub/code/modules/utils.
Create a file called helper.py in the utils directory.
Copy this file to the backups directory.
Remove the entire modules directory and its contents.
