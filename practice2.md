# File System Mastery Challenge

## Challenge Objective

**Create, navigate, and manipulate a structured directory system according to specific requirements.**  
This challenge will test your ability to use essential Linux commands: `mkdir`, `touch`, `rm`, `cp`, `pwd`, `cd`, and `ls` to build, explore, and modify a file system.

---

## Challenge Description

### 1. Setup

- **Begin by creating a base directory structure in your home directory:**
    - Create a directory called `project_hub` inside your `practice` directory.
    - Inside `project_hub`, create three subdirectories: `docs`, `code`, and `backups`.
    - Navigate to each directory to verify their creation.

---

### 2. File Creation and Management

- In the `docs` directory, create three text files:
    - `readme.txt`
    - `instructions.txt`
    - `notes.txt`
- In the `code` directory, create two files:
    - `script.py`
    - `config.json`
- Create a hidden file called `.settings` in the `project_hub` directory.

---

### 3. Navigation and Verification

- Use appropriate commands to list and verify the contents of each directory.
- Navigate between directories using both **absolute** and **relative** paths.
- At each step, verify your current location.

---

### 4. File Operations

- Copy `readme.txt` from `docs` to the `backups` directory.
- Create a new directory called `archive` inside `backups`.
- Copy **all files** from `docs` to the `archive` directory.
- Remove the `instructions.txt` file from the original `docs` directory.

---

### 5. Advanced Structure

- Create a nested directory structure: `project_hub/code/modules/utils`.
- Create a file called `helper.py` in the `utils` directory.
- Copy this file to the `backups` directory.
- Remove the entire `modules` directory and its contents.

**Good luck!**
