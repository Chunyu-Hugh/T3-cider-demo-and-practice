# Data Detective

This is a nice exercise bearing the flavor of cyber-sleuth (i.e. cyber-forensic researcher).

Imagine that you are a cyber detective in a famous Chicago-based Invincible Cyber Security, tasked by Chicago Police Department to search a server that was just seized from an infamous cyber crime gang called **Bloody Hound**. Police believed that this server holds credentials that can unlock all the victims’ servers and computers, so they asked you to find the right files to end this gang’s vice.

## Challenge Objective

Navigate through a complex file system to uncover a series of clues hidden within text files. Each clue will lead to the next location or file, requiring you to use Linux text processing commands to extract specific information.

This challenge tests your ability to use `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, `cat`, `less`, `wc`, `head`, `tail`, and `grep` to analyze files and follow a trail of breadcrumbs.

## Challenge Instructions

### The Data Detective Challenge

You've been assigned to locate a critical file containing security credentials that has been hidden somewhere in the system. You'll need to follow a trail of clues, each leading to the next location. The challenge will test your ability to:

- Navigate through directories
- Analyze file contents
- Filter specific information
- Use text processing commands to extract clues

**Begin by reading the `README.txt` file in the main directory.**  
Each clue will direct you to use specific commands to locate the next piece of information. Pay close attention to details about file sizes, line counts, specific text patterns, and file attributes.
